# Algo Visualizer
# Project 3

# URL https://algos-app.netlify.app

# Goal
- As a software engineering student, like many others, I struggle with algorithms especially because I am mostly a visual learner. Therefore this project would help people like me understand better how algorithms work in a fun and easy to remember way.

# User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to choose an algorythm out of the list provided.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how the chosen algo is working in a visual manner.
- As a user, I want this app to be beginner friendly.
- As a user, I want to be able to use this app on any device.

# Stretch 
- As a user, I want to be able to signup/login to be able to favorite an algo.
- As a user, I want to be able to comment or rate an algo.
- As a user, I want to be able to change colors of the visual graph.
